Hello AES Team,

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to do this coding project. It has been fun and challenging at the same time.

Steps to get the app running:
1. ```bundle install```
2. ```rails db:migrate```
3. ```rails s```

Hopefully without any errors, that should be good.

Dev notes:
1. I did not create a db:seed for you guys so I apologize for that.
2. Instead of using devise, I manually created a crappy user system that has "somewhat" of password encryption. I did this due to wanting to use a lot of different attributes.
3. You may see that I used different methods to figure out a way to have nested models and nested forms (the crappy way and a more efficient way) [strictly speaking, the crappy way was Answer model and the more efficient one was Comment model]
4. I got majority of the required steps including the bonus steps but there may be some that I may have missed. (Hopefully nothing crucial).
5. I did not account for every possible cases in terms of validations and errors, but I should have taken care of the obvious cases.
6. Implement a really crappy way to download the csv file but the url is ```localhost:3000/questions.csv```
7. I had a lot of fun working on this and would love to move on to the next step and/or talk about this assignment in a call.
8. Thank you so much for your time and patience as things have been incredibly crazy and scheduled impact the past couple of weeks. Appreciate it.
9. Looking foward to hearing from AES soon.
